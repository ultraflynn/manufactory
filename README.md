# manufactory
EVE Online PI installation modeller

The EVE Online PI system is notoriously difficult to work with in anything other than
a trivial application. When you starting running multiple accounts and have many different
end-products it becomes harder and harder to track the factory configuration using the
traditional means; i.e. a spreadsheet.

_manufactory_ provides a means to model you factory layout and validate that it is going to
do what it's intended.

## Raison d'Ãªtre

The intention is not to plan PI factory installations, it is to validate them. Other tools
focus on the planning, _manufactory_ allows you to prove it will work over time and will
guide as to the resource requirements to run without interruption.
